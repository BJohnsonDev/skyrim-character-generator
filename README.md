# Skyrim Character Generator

This Skyrim character generator was forked from [this CodePen created by nekoyoubi](https://codepen.io/nekoyoubi/pen/xddPoo) (currently non-functional) which was itself an adaptation from [Porchdrinker's dice-rolling method over on the Skyrim Forums](http://skyrimforums.org/sf/threads/random-character-creation-system-long.19549/). Full credit for the concept goes to them. I've tried my best to stay true to the original vision while adding my own fixes and improvements.

Name generation has been completely rewritten based on [conantroutman's name generator](https://github.com/conantroutman/vue-tesnamegenerator)

Feel free to suggest additions/changes, fork this repo, mock my poorly written code, etc.
